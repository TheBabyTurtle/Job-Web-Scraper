# Job-Web-Scraper
This project is a python-based web scraper. We used PyCharm as our IDE.
Our motivation for this project to learn how to reduce the time spent looking for a job by viewing data from multiple websites.
It can scrape job listing information such as job title, location, job description, and a link from seven websites simultaneously.
It can then return this information to the user through the Graphical User Interface.
It makes use of three libraries: Beautiful Soup, PySimpleGUI, and Asyncio.
The main class runs the whole program.
Each website method is coded slightly differently as each website is unique.
The user can choose which website to gather information through the checkboxes on the GUI and then add parameters such as Job Title with the text boxes.
The Combo class was the orginial test of a few websites running together with the GUI.
The other classes were created to test each website individaully before adding them to the main class.
